title: 2023-24 Spurs Opponent FGA By Center
---

In this project, I will investigate the shot selection of the Spurs' opponent's based on the center on the court for San Antonio. The centers evaluated are
* <span style="color:#EF426F">Victor Wembanyama</span>,
* <span style="color:#00B2A9">Zach Collins</span>,
* and both <span style="color:#FF8200">Wembanyama and Collins</span> together.

Shotcharts for each lineup are below. Note these include both missed and made field goals.
